The course has been altered. The target is Earth. In a remote observatory, Dr. Lehman (Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd, \"Back to the Future\"), discovers a meteor approximately three times the size of Mount Everest barreling its way towards Earth. His devoted young assistant Imogene O\\'Neill (Marla Sokoloff, \"The Practice\") feverishly types in the coordinates only to find the previously identified meteor named Kassandra is headed their way. It\\'s only the beginning of their troubles as showers of smaller meteorites begin to lay waste to major cities around the globe.</p><p>The impending disaster brings out the best and the worst sides in people as they cope by either lending a helping hand or taking advantage of the situation. In a small California town, a police chief (Golden Globe nominee Stacy Keach, \"Prison Break\") struggles to calm a panicky group of citizens. Miles away, his son Jack, a detective (Golden Globe nominee Billy Campbell, \"Once and Again\"), finds himself caught in the middle of the most difficult arrest of his career with the ill-timed transfer of a very dangerous psychopath named Stark (Michael Rooker, \"JFK\"). Then there\\'s the skeptical Dr. Chetwyn (Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Jason Alexander, \"Seinfeld\") who may be the only chance Lehman and O\\'Neill have to get their findings to the proper authorities in time to deflect Kassandra.</p><p>Time is running out in <i>Meteor</i>, in which eye-popping effects, explosive human drama, and hair-raising action combine to create a suspenseful, thrilling and dramatic new miniseries event from RHI Entertainment.</p>']\n",
